## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get **CoSketch** up and running locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** (v1.2.5 or later)
- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **Docker** (for PostgreSQL)

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Bun** installed globally, then install all packages:

```sh
bun install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create environment files for each app:

1. Copy the example environment files
2. Rename them to `.env` in each app directory
3. Fill in the required values like `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`, etc.


### Run the Application

#### Development Mode

Start all apps in development mode:

```sh
bun run dev
```

This uses Turborepo to run all services concurrently.

#### Production Mode

To build and start all services:

```sh
bun run build
bun run start
```

### Start Individual Apps

You can also start specific apps individually:

```sh
# Start frontend only
bun run start:frontend

# Start backend API only
bun run start:backend

# Start WebSocket server only
bun run start:websocket
```
